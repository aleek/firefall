# Firefall
Couple of days ago (today is 30.11.2016) I've found a achive of my old PHP/web projects, written somewhere between 2003 and 2009.
One of them is this PHP Generic Framework. It should run on PHP5. Most comments are in Polish language.

# This is some serious shit!
So, if you are here and want to use it, please do! But please let me know, if you use it.
